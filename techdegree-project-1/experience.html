                    <p>For the last 8 years, I have worked in the hospitality industry.</p>
                </h3>
                <p>I began to move my way up into management when I realised that the industry was not fulfilling my desire for mental stimulation.</p>
                <p>I tested different career paths, because for a long time, I did not know where I would thrive.</p>
                <p>Careers I have previously studied:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>real estate</li>
                    <li>childcare</li>
                    <li>psychological sciences</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although none of the above had me interested enough to pursue it for a career.</p>

                <p>One aftenoon, I was searching through the list of TAFE courses to see if anything piqued my curiosity.</p>
                <h3>That is when I stumbled upon web development! The further I researched deeper into the subject and watched youtube videos and played with trial versions, the more I was certain that this was the career path for me.</h3>
